# Project Overview

## Project Name

BMI Calculator 

## Project Description

This web application allows a user to determine their BMI. After entering it, they will be shown their results and how to interpret them and their its significance. 

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## API and Data Sample

<!-- Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below: -->

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recR6hpiYWuyfVGur",
            "fields": {
                "weight": 79,
                "calculation": 25.79591836734694,
                "height": 1.75,
                "category": "overweight"
            },
            "createdTime": "2022-01-07T21:10:26.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "rec25mbbWGewOrDmR",
            "fields": {
                "calculation": 16.3265306122449,
                "height": 1.75,
                "category": "underweight",
                "weight": 50
            },
            "createdTime": "2022-01-07T21:10:26.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recKB9UL8QUcnM7Io",
            "fields": {
                "calculation": 24.489795918367346,
                "weight": 75,
                "category": "normal",
                "height": 1.75
            },
            "createdTime": "2022-01-07T21:10:26.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "itrFy0PpjuxU94yHI/recKB9UL8QUcnM7Io"
}

```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Create and use external API
- Create get functionality to render data into components
- Create post functionality to allow a user to add to the data
- Create functionality for a user to input weight and height
- Create both imperial and metric systems to be used
- Create submission button for both systems
- Create a results page in which the user is given information in regards to their BMI
- Create a Why BMI? Page. To provide more information to user 


#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- To somehow have it so it is posted one at a time. So the results page does not get bloated. 
- For the imperial input, create an input that takes x(foot) y
- 

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|January 8-10| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|January 10| Project Approval | Incomplete
|January 11| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|January 12| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|January 13| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|January 14| MVP | Incomplete
|January 18| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
